            <h2>Blade Runner (1982)</h2>
            <p>Los Angeles, 2019. Humanity has reached new heights of technological prowess, but in the process has
                caused irreversible damage to the environment and their own mental stability. Rick Deckard is a blade
                runner, a cop who specializes in hunting down and "retiring" replicants, genetically-engineered beings
                created to do the dangerous and degrading work that humans won't do. When four replicants escape from an
                offworld colony and make their way to Earth, Deckard is called in to track them down.</p>
            <p class="hide">Deckard's investigation leads him to a rogue replicant named Rachael, who is different from
                the others because she doesn't know she's a replicant. As Deckard begins to fall in love with Rachael,
                he must also confront the morality of his job and the existential implications of replicants that are
                becoming more human than their creators.</p>
